# gRCP-chat
This is just a small gRCP-chat whearas I try to understand the concepts of gRCP.    
I've created a small client-server solution for a command line chat.  

# Server
In order to run the server you just need to change directory into `server`.  
There after you can run the solution by running the following command `go run main.go`.  
When the server is running you can go ahead and start the client.  

# Client
In order to run the client you just need to change directory into `client`.  
The client takes two arguments for running.   
So to get the client started you need to write the following command `go run main.go <server ip>:8080 <your chat alias>`.
